TASK :4. RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Recommendation System using collaborative filtering based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm from the scikit-surprise library. A sample movie rating dataset is used to simulate user preferences, and the model is trained to predict ratings for unseen items. The process includes data preprocessing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the SVD model, and evaluating its performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). The system also generates personalized recommendations for users based on predicted ratings. This project provides a clear example of how collaborative filtering can be applied to build intelligent recommendation systems using Python.
